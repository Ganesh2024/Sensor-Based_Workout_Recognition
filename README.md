# Bear Ball Exercise Prediction 🏋️‍♂️  

## 📌 Overview  

This project predicts **Bear Ball exercise types** and counts the **number of repetitions** performed by a user in real-time.  

It focuses on 5 major Bear Ball exercises (e.g., Squat, Row, etc.) and uses **machine learning models** to classify the exercise being performed with high accuracy.  

The system is designed to assist in **fitness monitoring and performance analysis**, making workouts smarter and trackable.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Predicts the type of Bear Ball exercise (5 categories supported).
   
- ✅ Counts the number of repetitions automatically.
  
- ✅ High prediction accuracy achieved through ML models.
  
- ✅ Easy-to-use interface for training and testing.
    
- ✅ Extensible for adding new exercise categories.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python 3.x
  
- **Libraries**:
  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → data preprocessing
    
  - `scikit-learn`, `xgboost` (or your actual ML models) → training & prediction
      
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → visualization
    
- **Environment**: Conda / Virtualenv (requirements provided in `requirements.txt`)
